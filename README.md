BDMMPrime
=========

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/tgvaughan/bdmm.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/tgvaughan/bdmm)

The BDMM project provides a [BEAST 2](http://www.beast2.org/) package for
performing phylodynamic inference under a structured birth-death model.

BDMMPrime is a fork of the [BDMM project](https://github.com/denisekuehnert/bdmm) aimed at making the package simultaneously
more flexible and easier to use.  It employs an exact stochastic mapping algorithm
rather than MCMC in order to sample state changes along tree lineages.

BDMMPime is currently still in development and is not yet ready for general use.
Instead, refer to the original [BDMM project](https://github.com/denisekuehnert/bdmm).
